## RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol

### Introduction

* Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a technology that enables two computers to connect over a network.

* It allows users to access software and files on another computer, even if that computer is located far away, such as in another country.

### Features

* RDP is a Remote Desktop application that connects two computers on distant locations.

* It operates on a default port and provides several features, including printer sharing, internet sharing, and file sharing.

* RDP is an interesting technology that allows users to print data from a remote computer onto their local printer and hear
audio output from a remote computer on their local speakers, among other things.

### Uses

* Microsoft initially introduced RDP as a means of helping users troubleshoot computer-related problems.

* Today, companies that provide computer support services use RDP to connect to clients' computers and solve problems remotely.

### Requirements

* To connect to a remote computer using RDP, the user needs to have the remote computer's IP address, computer name, and password.

* Once connected, the user can transfer files, use the remote computer's fast internet connection, and access other features.

### Conclusion

* Overall, RDP is a powerful technology that enables users to connect and access remote computers from anywhere in the world.

## KVM: Keyboard, Mouse and Video
 
### Introduction

* KVM, short for Keyboard Video Mouse switch, is a tool that enables users to connect multiple computers using a single keyboard, video, and mouse.

* It is a powerful technology that simplifies the use of multiple computers, especially in an office setting.

### Features

* KVM switch allows users to use multiple computers with one keyboard, mouse, and video.

* This makes it easier to switch between computers and saves time in switching cables.

* With the help of a KVM switch, a user can control multiple computers from one location.

### Uses

* In an office, a user can connect multiple computers using a KVM switch and use a single set of keyboard, video, and mouse to control them.

* This makes it easier to switch between computers and saves time in switching cables.

* Similarly, if a user has two computers on their desk, they can use a single KVM switch to connect them and control them from one location.

### Requirements

* A KVM switch requires a set of cables to connect to the computers it controls.

* Once connected, the user can switch between computers using a hotkey or a button on the KVM switch.

### Conclusion

* Overall, KVM switch is a powerful technology that simplifies the use of multiple computers.

* It saves time in switching cables and enables users to control multiple computers from one location.
 
## Difference between KVM and RDP:

* KVM (Keyboard, Video, and Mouse) and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) are both technologies that enable users to access and control remote computers, but they have some key differences.

* KVM is primarily used in an office setting, and it allows users to switch between computers using a single keyboard, video, and mouse. 

* On the other hand, RDP is more commonly used in remote technical support because it allows users to access another computer remotely and use its resources, such as its internet connection and printer. 

* KVM also provides fewer features than RDP, but it requires less setup and is easier to use, since a KVM switch connects computers using a single set of cables.
